              In 2017 South Africa participated in the [International RSE Survey](https://github.com/softwaresaved/international-survey) run by the Software Sustainability Institute for the first time. With the help of Peter van Heusden (South African National Bioinformatics Institute) and Anelda van der Walt (Talarify), the survey questions were localised to speak to the South African context. The survey and data is [accessible online](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2018-03-12-what-do-we-know-about-rses-results-our-international-surveys).

              In 2018 South Africa participated in the [International RSE Survey](https://github.com/softwaresaved/international-survey) again. The survey and data is [accessible online](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2018-03-12-what-do-we-know-about-rses-results-our-international-surveys). Talarify supported the roll-out of the survey in Africa.

              In 2017 Simon Hettrick, Deputy Director of the SSI, lead a funding application to support travel for three African RSE community members to participate in the [first international RSE Group Leaders Meeting](http://researchsoftware.org/2018/04/23/int-rsel-workshop.html) in London. Participants included Jessica Upani (Namibia / Python Africa), Mesfin Diro (Addis Ababa Institute of Technology, Ethiopia) and Samar Elsheikh (Computational Biology division at the University of Cape Town, South Africa / Sudan).

              The Research Software and Systems Engineers of Africa (RSSE Africa) forum grew out of the experience of RSSEs (primarily at SANBI at the University of the Western Cape, in Cape Town, South Africa) in supporting colleagues across the continent. It was launched in November 2019 (at the ASBCB 2019 conference https://www.iscb.org/iscbafrica2019) as an informal skills sharing forum. Our aims are to raise awareness of the specific contributions that RSSEs make to research in Africa, to organise events for RSSEs on the continent and the provide a forum for sharing skills and opportunities within the community.

              The forum founders were [Peter van Heusden](../authors/peter_vanheusden/) and [Eugene de Beste](../authors/eugene_debeste/) from the SANBI, South Africa.

            The [Open Life Science Training and Mentorship Programme](https://openlifesci.org/) is a 16-week long mentorship and cohort-based training for people interested in applying open principles in their work and becoming Open Science ambassadors in their communities. In 2020 RSSE Africa was accepted as a project in the OLS programme. Project leads Peter van Heusden and Eugene de Beste aimed to use this opportunity to grow the community in terms of visibility and participation.

            This was at the height of the COVID pandemic, but despite the challenges faced, the team created a new website for RSSE Africa and much more during the 16-week programme.

            In March 2022 Talarify committed to support the RSSE-Africa community by organising regular monthly meetups. The programme kicked off in May 2022. We had amazing support from the UK RSE community members who volunteered to join as presenters and share their knowledge and expertise about the global RSE movement, resources, opportunities, training, and more.

            Every alternative month we invited the African RSSE community to join us for a presentation followed by discussion and inbetween, we focussed our meetups on getting to know each other and contextualising the new knowledge to identify opportunities in the African context.

            In 2022 [ReSA](https://www.researchsoft.org/) commisioned a survey of research software organisations, projects, communities and funders [in the Global South](https://www.researchsoft.org/blog/2022-10/). The data and report is available on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/7179892#.Y9YQxdJByV4). For this mapping exercise, a number of African RSE community members were recruited as consultants to ensure the project could build on local knowledge as RSE is not yet a term widely known on the continent.

            To build on the momentum from the mapping project by ReSA and the consultants, and to incorporate additional knowledge of the local landscape, Talarify submitted another project to the Open Life Science programme, this time with a focus on finding local stakeholders and creating an interactive map where both ReSA data and the new information from the latest mapping exercise would be displayed.

            __Project title__: [Mapping the RSSE landscape in Africa](../mapping/)

            __Project outcomes__:
            1. More than 150 additional African research software stakeholders were identified and included in the dataset;
            2. A new form was developed to capture information from the African community;
            3. An interactive R Shiny web app was developed to display the data on a map; and
            4. A lot of new awareness was created about the global RSE movement and RSSE-Africa in particular. Talarify showcased the mapping project at the World Science Forum in December 2022 in Cape Town, South Africa.

            Over the past few years a number of international RSE communities have launched features on their websites showcasing the different careerpaths, job titles, roles, and more of their community members through interview-style posts. See for example [RSE Australia](https://rse-aunz.github.io/posts/), and the [Society of Research Software Engineering](https://society-rse.org/careers/case-studies/).

            In order to grow more visibility of African RSSEs, provide some value for our community members, and to have an opportunity to get to know our members better, we launched the [RSSE Africa Community Spotlights](../spotlights/) in January 2023.
