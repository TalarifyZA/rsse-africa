## About

In 2022 we ran virtual monthly meetups and spend a little bit of time during every event to introduce ourselves and get to know each other. This year we want to level up and do a bit more to learn about our community members' diverse backgrounds, experiences, achievements, challenges, and more.

## How

Each month we'll share an interview with at least one community member [in the newsletter](https://talarify.us14.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=35d5db26d3b108b9ef9b9ac43&id=55e9f5a692) and on the website.

The interview questions is available online. Please take a look at them and let us know if you're interested to be featured as our community member of the month? You will also have an option to follow up with a virtual presentation about your work in a [subsequent community meetup](../#events).
